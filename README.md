## FOA: ♫ Tell me *Y* ♪

The ideas/purposes behind every shiny app in this repository are:

- Being a complement for a ML, Statistics, Probability, R class. The
  application mainly shows and exemplifies a *result* that needs to be
  explained. By themselves, the apps are just an app.
- Point out other resources and links that are more formal and/or
  useful.
- TBD.

## Using apps locally

There is a script `run_app.R` which contanins a helper function to
download the repo in a temporal folder and then you can run the apps

To load that function:

``` r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbkunst/shiny-apps-edu/master/run_app.R")
```

Then you can use it giving the folder name, for example:

``` r
run_app("kmeans")
```
