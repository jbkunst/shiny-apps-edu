## FOA: ♫ Tell me *Y* ♪

The ideas/purposes behind every shiny app in this repository are:

-   Being a complement for a ML, Statistics, Probability, R class. The
    application mainly shows and exemplifies a *result* that needs to be
    explained. By themselves, the apps are just an app.
-   Point out other resources and links that are more formal and/or
    useful.
-   TBD.

## ~~Using apps locally~~

Use `subdir` argument to select the app to run, in this example the app
selected is `"matrix-decompositions"`.

``` r
shiny::runGitHub(repo = "shiny-apps-edu", username = "jbkunst", subdir = "matrix-decompositions")
```

(Sadly *AFAIK* `shiny::runGitHub` with rmarkdown `runthime:shiny`
files.)
