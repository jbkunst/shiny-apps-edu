In evey image each pixel have a color and every color have an rgb representation 
(a 3-coordinates point), so we can group the colors into clusters and see what happens.
The pixel have a position too so a pixel can be represented as a 5 tuple of values.
The idea behind this app is taken from [dsparks' kmeans palette](https://gist.github.com/dsparks/3980277). I just add some features like 3d scatterplot and migrate the code to a shiny app.

App made by [@jbkunst](https://twitter.com/jbkunst) with ❤️ and for fun with #rstats. Code
